After finishing my Chi Kung classes for this year, I entered a semi period of hibernation, in a way that this podcast is two days old. 

Do you need more then what you remember that you have?

That's a question that I posed myself some years ago, regarding the books that I've been accumulating and I bought fiercely in a specific time of my life - during my Chinese medical studies. 

Again I found this question when I did a clean install of my system. How many applications do I need? 

Enjoy your practice and happy sky gazing.
