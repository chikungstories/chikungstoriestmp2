New resolutions face some challenges, the biggest challenge is not outside but inside, as we deal with all our wanting to change what's already there for years, believing that can be changed like switching on a light bulb. 

Why it's so challenging after all? 

Why there is no recipe for it?

Happy new 2016. 

Enjoy your practice and happy sky gazing.
